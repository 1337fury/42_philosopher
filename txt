Yes, this warning from ThreadSanitizer (TSan) indicates that there is a data race in the program. Specifically, it shows two different warnings:

The main thread is writing a memory location of size 8 at address 0x7b0c000002a8 in the start_eat function, while thread T1 is reading the same memory location in the checker function.
Thread T1 is reading a memory location of size 8 at address 0x7b0c000002b0 in the checker function, while the main thread is writing the same memory location in the routine function.
The memory locations being accessed are part of a heap block of size 40 that was allocated by the main thread at address 0x7b0c000002a0 using malloc in the create_philosophers function.

Therefore, the data race appears to be occurring between the main thread and T1, where they are accessing the same memory locations without proper synchronization. The specific functions involved are start_eat, routine, create_philosophers, and checker.






Similar to the previous warning, this warning indicates a data race where one thread (T1) is reading a memory location while another thread (the main thread) is writing to the same location. The read is happening in the function put_msg() at address 0x7b0c000002b0, and the write is happening in the function routine() also at address 0x7b0c000002b0.

The memory location being accessed is a heap block of size 40 allocated by the main thread using malloc() at address 0x7b0c000002a0. Thread T1 was created by the main thread and is currently running when the read happens.

Once again, this warning message was generated by ThreadSanitizer, a tool used for detecting data races and other concurrency bugs in multithreaded code.
