# Dining philosophers problem
The `Dining philosophers problem` Project is an engaging programming challenge that simulates a round table of philosophers who alternate between eating, thinking, and sleeping. The simulation is set up with a large bowl of spaghetti in the middle of the table, and forks placed around it for the philosophers to use.

The challenge involves writing a program that ensures that each philosopher has access to the two forks they need to eat, and that they do not starve or die. The program must take into account the time it takes for each philosopher to eat, sleep, and think, and must also handle the situation where a philosopher dies of starvation.

In addition, the program must comply with specific global rules, such as not allowing the use of global variables and taking specific arguments for the number of philosophers, time limits, and number of times each philosopher must eat. The program must also output state changes for each philosopher, such as when they take a fork, eat, sleep, think, or die.

This challenge is not only a test of programming skills, but also a fun and creative way to explore the philosophical concept of the "dining philosophers problem", which has been used to illustrate issues with resource allocation in computer science and distributed systems. The 42 Philosopher Project is a great opportunity to exercise problem-solving skills and creativity, while also gaining a deeper understanding of the fascinating and complex world of philosophy.
